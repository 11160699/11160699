	<p>Sensoria, a leader in smart footwear, garments and IoT solutions, was awarded the Best New Wearable Technology Device prize at the 2015 IDTechEx Printed Electronics USA show, for its textile sensor infused smart socks.
IDTechEx Printed Electronics USA 2015 is the largest printed electronics and sensor event in the world. The Printed Electronics Awards recognize company innovation, success and development.
The Smart MBB is a foot and ankle support that is designed to help improve balance and stability for its wearers, and hence reduce the wearerâ€™s risk of falling. Infused with the same proprietary sensors that Sensoria developed for its Smart Socks, the Smart MBB is said to allow a clinician to accurately detect the activity of their patients and improve care delivery.
Sensoria has made available a full SDK to partners that want to develop sports, fitness and medical related scenarios.</p>
