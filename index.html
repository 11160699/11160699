	Wearable technology, also known as "wearables," is a category of electronic devices that can be worn as accessories, embedded in clothing, implanted in the user's body, or even tattooed on the skin.
        Wearable technology is any technology that is designed to be used while worn. Common types of wearable technology include smartwatches and smartglasses.<br> Wearable electronic devices are often close to or on the surface of the skin,<br> where they detect, analyze, and transmit information such as vital signs, and/or ambient data and which allow in some cases immediate biofeedback to the wearer.
        Wearable devices such as activity trackers are an example of the Internet of Things, since "things" such as electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity are effectors that enable objects to exchange data (including data quality[4])<br> through the internet with a manufacturer, operator, and/or other connected devices, without requiring human intervention. Wearable technology offers a wide range of possible uses, from communication and entertainment to improving health and fitness, however,<br> there are worries about privacy and security because wearable devices have the ability to collect personal data
