	<p>However, there is one other important distinction to be made about ARM’s processor range, besides different levels of performance, and that’s instruction sets.<br>Instruction sets provide an essential list of commands for the main processor.
		The familiar Cortex-A range supports the full ARM 32-bit instruction set, while the Cortex-M series uses ARM’s Thumb2 instruction set, a streamlined collection of the most commonly used 32-bit ARM instructions compressed into 16-bit wide opcodes.
		The condensed instruction set allows developers to get more done with the smaller<br.amounts of memory found in portable Cortex-M devices, at the cost of less efficient code for less frequently used instructions. Thumb2 is an enhancement on the original 16-bit Thumb instruction set,
		which adds in some 32-bit instructions for improved functionality.<p/>
